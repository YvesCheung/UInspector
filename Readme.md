        [See more](#Develop)

## Get Started

Add jcenter() to your project-level `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

Add dependency to your module-level `build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    // debugImplementation because Uinspector should only run in debug builds.
    debugImplementation 'com.huya.mobile:Uinspector:x.y.z'
}
```
> x.y.z replace with [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/yvescheung/maven/UInspector/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/yvescheung/maven/UInspector/_latestVersion)

**Thatâ€™s it, there is no code change needed!**

## Usage 

1. Start the inspector through the notification
2. Tap the view you want to inspect
3. Now you can see the properties on the popup panel

**4. Uinspector intercept the 'single tap' event, but you can perform click on a View by double tap instead!** And the scroll event/ key event can be dispatched as usual.

## Optional Dependencies

- **Glide**

    If an image is loaded with [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), you can inspect the properties on the ImageView:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YvesCheung/UInspector/master/art/glide.jpg" alt="Inspect ImageView with Glide" width="360">



    `glide model` : The image source, maybe an url or a resource id

    `glide error` : The error drawable

    `glide placeholder`: The place holder drawable
    
    All you need to do is Add the gradle dependency on the Glide integration library: 
    
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        debugImplementation 'com.huya.mobile:Uinspector-optional-glide:x.y.z'
    }
    ```
    > x.y.z replace with [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/yvescheung/maven/UInspector/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/yvescheung/maven/UInspector/_latestVersion)

#### To see more optional dependencies below:

- [**Fresco**](https://github.com/YvesCheung/UInspector/blob/master/docs/uinspector-optional-fresco.md)
- [**Lottie**](https://github.com/YvesCheung/UInspector/blob/master/docs/uinspector-optional-lottie.md)
- [**Inspect your own custom view**](https://github.com/YvesCheung/UInspector/blob/master/docs/uinspector-optional-custom-view.md)

## Develop

**Using Java SPI mechanism, You can develop your own panel and add it into `Uinspector`**

1. Create your custom `UInspectorChildPanelService` and `UInspectorChildPanel` in your module:

    ```kotlin
    package com.example
    import com.huya.mobile.uinspector.ui.panel.popup.UInspectorChildPanelService
    import com.huya.mobile.uinspector.ui.panel.popup.UInspectorChildPanel

    class YourPanelService: UInspectorChildPanelService {

        override fun createPanels(): Set<UInspectorChildPanel> {
            return setOf(YourPanel())
        }

        class YourPanel : UInspectorChildPanel{

            override val title = "YourPanelName"

            override fun onCreateView(context: Context): View {
                return ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Create a file named `com.huya.mobile.uinspector.ui.panel.popup.UInspectorChildPanelService` in directory `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/`. Write down your class name in the file:

    ```
    com.example.YourPanelService
    ```
    
3. Ok! Now you can run your app and find `YourPanel` in the uinspector!

See the sample in [src/main/resources/META-INF/services](https://github.com/YvesCheung/UInspector/blob/master/impl/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.huya.mobile.uinspector.ui.panel.popup.UInspectorChildPanelService)
